        A short story behind the NeoX grid and its cyber degenerates.
      </p>
      <p style="max-width:900px;font-size:14px;line-height:1.7;color:var(--text-main);">
        The NeoX grid is a permanent subnet living above the Monad chain. It’s a neon sprawl of
        datalines, noise, degen chatrooms and market feeds — a place where avatars never sleep
        and the only thing that matters is your on-chain identity.
        <br><br>
        NeoX CyberDegens are the native citizens of this grid: AI-assisted pixel punks spawned
        from corrupted punk DNA, upgraded with cyber implants, nightlife addictions and crypto
        obsessions. Each one carries a different combination of traits — from clean traders to
        toxic gamblers, from late-night coders to chain-smoking chart watchers.
        <br><br>
        There’s no central authority, no roadmap hype factory, no fake suits. Just 10,000 units
        of raw, on-chain culture built for people who actually live in this space.

          <div class="roadmap-title">Genesis Mint</div>
          <p>
            Launch NeoX CyberDegens on Monad with a clean mint experience, verified contract,
            transparent metadata and active support channels. Early minters form the core group
            for future experiments.

          <div class="roadmap-title">Holder Airdrops</div>
          <p>
            Periodic airdrops for NeoX holders: bonus artwork, derivative pieces, trait-based
            surprises and early access passes to side projects connected to the NeoX universe.

          <div class="roadmap-title">Website & Tools Upgrade</div>
          <p>
            Expand the NeoX site with richer tools: full trait explorer, rarity breakdowns, live
            feed of recent mints, and better discovery of individual CyberDegens. Make it easy to
            flex your identity and see the whole grid.

          <p>
            Explore lightweight staking or point-based systems for NeoX holders, focused on fun,
            status and access rather than empty “yield” promises. All mechanics will be announced
            transparently and only deployed when fully tested.
